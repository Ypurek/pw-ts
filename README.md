# One of my first serious TS Playwright playgrounds

## Reference
I have tried to make project similar to my test project template in python: [Infopulse Playwright Python](https://github.com/infopulse/Playwright-course-python)

## Features
- Page objects (with class extension / inheritance)
- Fixtures
- Non Playwright tests
- Typical default playwright tests
- Test with my own fixtures
- DDT tests
- Tests with replacing the network response

## Development
Despite I am a big fan of the PyCharm, this project was developed and tested in VS Code.
It is pretty ok. Can get used to it.

## Notes for future me
- TypeScript is better then JS. Typing in methods makes the code looks like my Python code
